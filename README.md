organize your desktop files

im tired of the mess on my desktop so i needed a simple solution to my pain. 
so i wrote this thing to put files in the folder with the name of its extension.
this works pretty well especialy with using such thing as wizTree, 
by using this you get a nice tree with all information about the size of the folders. 

that's pretty much it

heres some photos for better understanding what it does
