Organize your desktop files

I'm tired of the mess on my desktop so i coded this.
I wrote this thing to put files in the folder with the name of its extension.
I recommend using wizTree after this script, as it provides nice tree view.
Start the script using start.py

Works on windows only i think.

Also it has gui now. You can toggle it off if you dont want it, using "use gui" checkbox.
"clone executable" copies script to /organize/ folder on your desktop, so you dont need to search for it in the future.
